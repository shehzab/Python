# Python Learning Journey

Just my daily progress learning Python. I already know some other languages, so I'm starting from scratch but moving at my own pace.

**Heads up:** This isn't a tutorial or a complete learning resource. You'll probably miss some topics if you're trying to learn Python here.

I'm just journaling my progress and adding programs that are different from what I've seen in other languages.

That's it.
